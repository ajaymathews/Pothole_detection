  WriteMultipleFields
  
  Description: Writes values to fields 1,2,3,4 and status in a single ThingSpeak update every 20 seconds.
  
  Hardware: ESP8266 based boards
  
  !!! IMPORTANT - Modify the secrets.h file for this project with your network connection and ThingSpeak channel details. !!!
  
  Note:
  - Requires ESP8266WiFi library and ESP8622 board add-on. See https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino for details.
  - Select the target hardware from the Tools->Board menu
  - This example is written for a network using WPA encryption. For WEP or WPA, change the WiFi.begin() call accordingly.
  
  ThingSpeak ( https://www.thingspeak.com ) is an analytic IoT platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize, and 
  analyze live data streams in the cloud. Visit https://www.thingspeak.com to sign up for a free account and create a channel.  
  
  Documentation for the ThingSpeak Communication Library for Arduino is in the README.md folder where the library was installed.
